# E2E-Testing Brownbag

This repo should give you a short overview of e2e testing landscap and especially introduce you to e2e and integration testing with [https://www.cypress.io/](cypress.io).

This is a slideshow project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses the [spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) presentation library to present the content as well as to run tests on specific slides. I liked the idea of using a web based project for creating the slides as well as using it to show some of the tests. 

What this project should not be -> we dont want to cover all the things which are already provided by the awesome cypress documentation. We want to show things which may be/no be obvisouly when you want to start and I provide excuslive my opinion on stuff I write here. Please you don't have to aggree with the thinks I mention here.
